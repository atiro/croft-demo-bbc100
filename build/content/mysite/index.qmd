title: "Cultural Heritage Objects"
---
<p>This site gathers objects held in institutions in the UK (and beyond) to mark 100 years of the BBC. Objects range from Handstamps to Caps, with a variety of photographs, books, and costumes along the way (and, more rarely, iron railings, radio valves and defaced coins.</p><p>  Whilst hopefully of some interest in itself, this is also a test dataset to explore the (oft-desired) idea of a minimal dataset publishing tool, to turn a small quantity of data about a *thing* into a website/mobile webapp for ease of sharing, through visualisition of some standard view types (Table, Gallery, Map, (Data) Query). For many small datasets this may provide a quick way for data to be shared (and perhaps contributed) through the use of a GitHub repo which can rebuild a website on every commit updating the CSV data. This is of course not a new idea, and the problems with attempting to provide a generic publishing tool for any dataset are well known; the desire for data specific views tends to limit the usefulness of such tools. The aim for Croft therefore is to provide just enough to be useful as a quick publisher, but also to be a starting point for more complex projects if needed. To enable this, the core concepts have been taken from CIDOC-CRM/Linked Art data models, in theory the CSVs and configuration can be transformed with minimal effort into more complex Linked Data structures for more complex querying and custom web interfaces.</p><p> This site is built from CSV data in this repo. Croft itself is built on Python & used Quarto to publish its HTML. This site has no authorisation from any of the institutions that hold the objects, nor from the BBC itself.</p><p> Happy 100th Birthday British Broadcasting Corporation.</p>
