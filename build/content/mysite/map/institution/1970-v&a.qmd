description: "This costume was made for Prospect Theatre Companyâ€™s 1968 production of Richard II starring 29-year-old Ian McKellen as the King. Its five week tour was such a success that a second tour, starting at the Edinburgh Festival, was followed by a sell-out London run. It went on to tour Europe and was filmed by the BBC in 1970, establishing McKellen as a leading actor."
