description: "Mnemosyne refers to the mother of the Nine Muses who is also the personification of memory in Greek mythology. The film is also known as 'The Nine Muses' and features a tone poem composed of verses named after Mnemosyne and her daughters: Tragedy (Melpomene), History (Clio), Music (Euterpe), Sacred Song (Polyhymnia), Astronomy (Urania), Comedy (Thalia), Erotic Love (Erato), Dance (Terpsichore) and Epic Poetry (Calliope). Akomfrah created the film for the BBC/Arts Council 'Made in England' project and used archival material to retell the experience of post-war immigrants to the UK. Mnemosyne focuses on the West Midlands between 1960 and the 1980s with archival images  punctuated by others of a frozen wasteland.  "
