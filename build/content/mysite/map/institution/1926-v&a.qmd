description: "The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's new production of Gilbert and Sullivan's popular comic opera The Mikado at the Princes Theatre on Monday 20th September 1926 generated a huge amount of interest. Speculation about the new costumes designed by Charles Ricketts (1866-1931) generated a lot of press interest and speculation; tickets for the first night sold out months in advance, and the production was broadcast on the night on the radio live from the theatre by the BBC."
