Tales of Toytown is the book which resulted in a hugely popular run on BBC Radio in the late 1920s and early 1930s as part of the Children's Hour series. This particular book is a 1928 first edition and is the copy annotated by Hulme Beaman himself as he set to work converting the book stories into short plays for the radio."
