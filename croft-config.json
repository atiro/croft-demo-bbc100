   "intro_long": "<p>This site gathers objects held in institutions in the UK (and occasionally beyond) to mark 100 years of the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/100/\">BBC</a>. Objects collected range from Railings to Caps, with a variety of photographs, books, and costumes along the way (and, more rarely, iron railings, musket balls and defaced coins.</p><p>  Whilst hopefully of some interest in itself as a record of the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/\">BBC</a>'s cultural impact over the last 100 years, this site is also a test of an application (Croft - under development) to make publishing a small dataset with some standard data visualisations (Map, Table, Gallery) easier.</p><p> This site is built from CSV data in this GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/atiro/croft-demo-bbc100\">repo</a>. Croft itself is built on <a href=\"https://www.python.org\">Python</a> and uses <a href=\"https://quarto.org\">Quarto</a> to publish its HTML, with GitHub Actions rebuilding the site after any data update. All images are served from the hosting institution's <a href=\"https://iiif.io\">IIIF</a> image server where available. This site has no authorisation from any of the institutions that hold the objects, nor from the BBC.</p><p>Happy 100th Birthday British Broadcasting Corporation!</p>"
