This multimedia edition of the book was compiled between 1984 and 1986, and published in 1986. It included a survey of the United Kingdom, in which people, mostly school children, wrote about their daily lives. These accounts were linked with maps, coloured photos, statistics, videos, and 'virtual walks'. Over a million people participated in the project, including over 10,000 schools. It was the first ever participatory and community driven multimedia project. It was also a good example of the perils of media obsolescence - at the time, laser discs were the cutting edge of technology, but the Domesday interface required a BBC Master computer, costing around £5,000, meaning that the project was out of reach of many, and that only 1,000 were sold across the country. Today, both the BBC Master computer and laser discs have become rare, although a successful data retrieval project carried out by the National Archives in 2001 means that the data is now available online.

1994,Tate Modern,"Video, 4 monitors, colour and sound (stereo)","Royal Ascot","Mark Wallinger",,"Displayed on four monitors individually mounted on wheeled flight cases positioned side by side in the gallery, Royal Ascot 1994 is a four channel colour video showing members of the British royal family on processions at the famous race meeting referenced in the title. Each one of the monitors shows three minutes and forty-three seconds of unedited footage from the BBC’s televised coverage of Royal Ascot taken on successive days of the four-day event in 1994. The videos start at the same time on each screen and play simultaneously until they reach their end. Each day’s footage presents a succession of horse-drawn carriages that travels along the racecourse and into the paddock area, with the Queen, Prince Philip and other members of the royal family seen waving from the carriages to the surrounding crowds. At an almost identical point in each day’s procession, a military regiment plays the British national anthem. The BBC commentators praise the parades – with phrases such as ‘what a moment’, ‘wonderful scene’ and ‘a very relaxed atmosphere’ – and pay particularly close attention to the royal family’s clothing. Tate’s copy of Royal Ascot is number one in an edition of three plus one artist’s proof.",https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/wallinger-royal-ascot-t12810

2001,National Space Centre,Toy,Clanger,Peter & Joan Firmin,,"The Clangers is a British stop-motion animated television series for children. It features a family of pink mouse-like characters, who live on a small planet similar to the Moon and speak only in whistles. The series was produced for the BBC by Smallfilms, a company set up by Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin. Postgate was the writer, animator, and narrator and Firmin designed the characters. Firmin’s wife knitted the Clangers and made their costumes. This Clanger was knitted to the original pattern. The programme was initially broadcast from 1969 to 1972. This was the era of the Apollo Moon landings, so space exploration was an extremely popular topic. A new series was commissioned in 2015 after a special episode – Eclipse of the Sun, proved extremely popular. ",https://collections.spacecentre.co.uk/object-h2001-10

They presumably date from the English Civil War of 1642 to 1651, which saw Parliamentarians (or 'Roundheads') pitted against Royalists ('Cavaliers') in a series of political manoeuvres and armed conflicts. Among the Parliamentarians' victories we can count the Siege of Reading of 1643, when the Roundheads besieged and took over a Royalist garrison in the town. There were several skirmishes around Caversham especially during the siege, as both sides fought to control Caversham Bridge and access to Reading. In July 1647 King Charles was imprisoned at Caversham Park for several weeks. ",http://collections.readingmuseum.org.uk/index.asp?page=record&mwsquery=({search}=*{bbc})&filename=REDMG&hitsStart=51
