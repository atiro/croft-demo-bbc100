This multimedia edition of the book was compiled between 1984 and 1986, and published in 1986. It included a survey of the United Kingdom, in which people, mostly school children, wrote about their daily lives. These accounts were linked with maps, coloured photos, statistics, videos, and ‘virtual walks’. Over a million people participated in the project, including over 10,000 schools. It was the first ever participatory and community driven multimedia project. It was also a good example of the perils of media obsolescence - at the time, laser discs were the cutting edge of technology, but the Domesday interface required a BBC Master computer, costing around £5,000, meaning that the project was out of reach of many, and that only 1,000 were sold across the country. Today, both the BBC Master computer and laser discs have become rare, although a successful data retrieval project carried out by the National Archives in 2001 means that the data is now available online."

    "text": "The Clangers is a British stop-motion animated television series for children. It features a family of pink mouse-like characters, who live on a small planet similar to the Moon and speak only in whistles. The series was produced for the BBC by Smallfilms, a company set up by Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin. Postgate was the writer, animator, and narrator and Firmin designed the characters. Firmin’s wife knitted the Clangers and made their costumes. This Clanger was knitted to the original pattern. The programme was initially broadcast from 1969 to 1972. This was the era of the Apollo Moon landings, so space exploration was an extremely popular topic. A new series was commissioned in 2015 after a special episode – Eclipse of the Sun, proved extremely popular."

    "text": "Seven round cast-lead shot of various sizes for muskets and pistols were found by gardeners and builders working on the grounds at Caversham Park over the years when it was occupied by the BBC from 1943 until 2018. They presumably date from the English Civil War of 1642 to 1651, which saw Parliamentarians (or ‘Roundheads’) pitted against Royalists (‘Cavaliers’) in a series of political manoeuvres and armed conflicts. Among the Parliamentarians’ victories we can count the Siege of Reading of 1643, when the Roundheads besieged and took over a Royalist garrison in the town. There were several skirmishes around Caversham especially during the siege, as both sides fought to control Caversham Bridge and access to Reading. In July 1647 King Charles was imprisoned at Caversham Park for several weeks."

During the first two years of its existence, the BBC, then the British Broadcasting Company before it was incorporated several years later, relied heavily on royalties earned from radio receivers and accessories made by its member manufacturing companies. Before each radio went into production a sample was sent to the Post Office to check that it didn’t produce electrical interference. Approved sets were given their own General Post Office (GPO) registration number which had to be displayed on the set, along with a stamp with the words ‘TYPE APPROVED BY THE POST MASTER GENERAL’, as shown in this stamp. This particular kind of stamp was in use from November 1922 to September 1924."

After three years at Richmond School of Art where she won a London County Council scholarship, Phyllis Ginger ( 1907-2005) attended the Central School of Arts and Crafts. She later contributed watercolours and drawings to ‘Recording Britain’, an ambitious Second World War project intended to employ artists on the home front and celebrate the country’s architectural history. In 1952 Ginger was elected to the Royal Society of Painters in Watercolours, with which she exhibited until her death."

    "text": "Displayed on four monitors individually mounted on wheeled flight cases positioned side by side in the gallery, Royal Ascot 1994 is a four channel colour video showing members of the British royal family on processions at the famous race meeting referenced in the title. Each one of the monitors shows three minutes and forty-three seconds of unedited footage from the BBC’s televised coverage of Royal Ascot taken on successive days of the four-day event in 1994. The videos start at the same time on each screen and play simultaneously until they reach their end. Each day’s footage presents a succession of horse-drawn carriages that travels along the racecourse and into the paddock area, with the Queen, Prince Philip and other members of the royal family seen waving from the carriages to the surrounding crowds. At an almost identical point in each day’s procession, a military regiment plays the British national anthem. The BBC commentators praise the parades – with phrases such as ‘what a moment’, ‘wonderful scene’ and ‘a very relaxed atmosphere’ – and pay particularly close attention to the royal family’s clothing. Tate’s copy of Royal Ascot is number one in an edition of three plus one artist’s proof."

Croft itself is built on Python and uses Quarto to publish its HTML, with GitHub Actions rebuilding the site after any data update. All images are served from the hosting institution’s IIIF image server where available. This site has no authorisation from any of the institutions that hold the objects, nor from the BBC.\n\n\nHappy 100th Birthday British Broadcasting Corporation!"
